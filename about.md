The Michaelion was a roman sanctuary, dedicated to Archangel Micheal and built around 300 AD{% fn %}.

Coincidentally, it is also my name. Since September 1992 AD.

I'm a Master student of Business Informatics at Vienna Technical University, before that I did a Bachelors in Computer Science / Visual Computing. I also studied for a term INSA Lyon, France.

I am the sort of person who has to think hard of the answer to the question "what are your hobbies? what do you enjoy doing?".

Based on the time of asking and my mood I would respond... I love traveling, practicing foreign languages, playing the piano, playing board games, working out or jogging, spending time with friends and family, cooking... You know, the usual stuff.

      <i><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelion'>Actually, there was already a greek temple before that at this place, even with a statue of a winged deity and was just converted later on with the 'Christianity' stamp put on. Kinda like Christmas.</a></i>
