Web Sliding Puzzle
==================

Sliding Puzzle is a simple web app originally made during and for the Firefox OS
App days in Paris.

It should work fine most modern mobile and desktop browsers (except Opera 
because its support File API is incomplete). It was tested on latest versions of
Firefox, Safari and Chrome on all platforms.

You can see it in action at this URL : http://sliding-puzzle.virgule.net/
